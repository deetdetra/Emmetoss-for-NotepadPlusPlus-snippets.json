EmmetExtended 'Emmetoss' for Notepad++  snippets.json Merge
============================

Emmet Extended Emmetoss Notepad++, merge of 'snippets.json' file shipped 
when you install Emmet (zen coder) plugin in Notepad Plus Plus (on Windows) 
with the extended version provided called Emmetoss - I used winMerge software
to make the merge.

I strongly suggest you make a vanilla(untouched/edited) backup of your
snippets.json file after you have installed the plugin through the 'plugin manager' of
Notepad++.

to do:

Check with emmet.io that this repo has not changed some of the standard shipped
emmet.io codes docummented in the cheatsheet page - at the momment it has added 
only new snippets - 

Check if its converted properly to unix like 'LF' - done
