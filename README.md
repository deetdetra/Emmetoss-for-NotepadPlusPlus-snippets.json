EmmetExtended_Npp_json_Merge
============================

Emmet Extended Emmetoss Npp Merge of snippets.json shipped 
when you install plugin in Notepad Plus Plus (on Windows) 
and the extended version provided called Emmetoss - I used winMerge software
to make the merge.

I strongly suggest you make a vanilla(untouched/edited) backup of your
snippets.json file after you have installed the plugin through the 'plugin manager' of
Notepad++.

to do:
Check with emmet.io that this repo has not changed some of the standard shipped
emmet.io codes docummented in the cheatsheet page

Check if its converted properly to unit like 'LF'
